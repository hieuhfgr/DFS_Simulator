# Auto generate a Tree and DFS Code Simulator

- Author: [hieuhfgr](hieuhfgr.pythonanywhere.com).
- Version: 1.0

Run `DFS.py`

### * Note
- It can not simulate large Tree.
- File `DFS.py` can generate a Tree, simulate DFS on a Tree from gen or from your file.
If you want to simulate your Tree, make sure to change `DFS.INP` (import your Tree (do not insert first line `n`))  and change the text `meh.gen(30)` to `meh.readFile()`.

Have fun ;)
